Redshift GNOME shell extension
==============================

This redshift extension is a native redshift implementation for GNOME. For
it to work changes in the color mangement of gnome-settings-daemon are
required. However, because it hooks into the GNOME color management, any
color profile that adjustes the gamma curves of the monitor automatically
will keep working.

Installation
============

To install the extension, run ./make-zip.sh and install the created zipfile.

To use it you also need to apply the gnome-settings-daemon patch which is in
the patches subdirectory. A version for 3.22 and current master (2016-11-19)
is supplied, only the 3.22 version is tested.

This extension will do nothing if you do not patch gnome-settings-daemon!

Location
========

The shell will prompt you to give GNOME Maps access to the current location
this is because redshift uses this location to calculte the dusk and dawn
times.

Bugs/Issues/Improvements
========================

* Currently the gnome-maps ID is used for GeoClue. Using our own does not work
  without providing a desktop file (and I am not sure how to ship that)
* The dusk/dawn times should be configurable to be a fixed local time
* The preference dialog is ugly

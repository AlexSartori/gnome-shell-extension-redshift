Redshift GNOME shell extension
==============================

This redshift extension is a native redshift implementation for GNOME. For
it to work changes in the color mangement of gnome-settings-daemon are
required. However, because it hooks into the GNOME color management, any
color profile that adjustes the gamma curves of the monitor automatically
will keep working.

To test you need to apply the gnome-settings-daemon patch which is in the
patches subdirectory. A version for 3.22 and current master (2016-11-19)
is supplied, only the 3.22 version is tested.

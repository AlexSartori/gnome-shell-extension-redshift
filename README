WARNING: The GeoClue2 integration is pretty much broken. Sometimes it does
not work at all, sometimes it freezes the whole shell. There seem to be two
issues, one is that the class is registered multiple times (or not
unregistered properly) and the other is that the GeoClue2 service complains
about timeouts on the DBus connection.

Redshift GNOME shell extension
==============================

This redshift extension is a native redshift implementation for GNOME. For
it to work changes in the color mangement of gnome-settings-daemon are
required. However, because it hooks into the GNOME color management, any
color profile that adjustes the gamma curves of the monitor automatically
will keep working.

To test you need to apply the gnome-settings-daemon patch in
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=742149.
